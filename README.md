# Rubik's-Cube 
Rubik's Cube Solving Algorithm

This project reads a cube's initial state and implements Rubik's cube solving algorithm.
The actions are visualized using an online simulator i.e., [Google Doodle Cube](https://www.google.com/doodles/rubiks-cube).

## Instructions to use
You can then either run the code directly on the visual studio using [Rubicks Cube.sln](https://github.com/milind-prajapat/Rubiks-Cube/blob/Algorithm/Rubicks%20Cube.sln) or can run [Rubicks_Cube.py](https://github.com/milind-prajapat/Rubiks-Cube/blob/Algorithm/Rubicks_Cube.py).

## Features
1. Image processing helps to fetch the initial state of the cube
2. The code controls the Keyboard keys, further influencing the simulator through which every step is visualized
3. The Algorithm used is based on beginner's method
